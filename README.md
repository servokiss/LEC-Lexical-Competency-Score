# LEC-Lexical-Competency-Score
LEC (Lexical Competency) System: Comprehensive Guide - Geared for engineers, usable by anyone.

---

## 1. Purpose & Philosophy

The **LEC System** is designed to enhance participants’ language abilities by tracking, scoring, and providing actionable feedback on their symbolic (lexical) fluency within a defined context (“hat”). It measures and promotes growth in domain-specific vocabulary, conceptual application, and typing fluency, always using **positive framing** to encourage motivation and self-improvement.

This can be applied towards software development environments and generaly study - particularly that of AI enhanced learning environments.  This system is particularly effective in coding environments as language as a syntax can drive LEC scores in real-time and easily through browser based environments.  

**Key Principle:**  
All metrics and user-facing feedback are framed to reinforce a growth mindset—progress is celebrated, and areas for improvement are treated as opportunities, not failures.

Actionability:  The parallel of understanding subjects, their language and an individuals proportional action is directly demonstratable and can be observed in realtime - particularly with AI.

## 2. Core Concepts & Definitions

### 2.1 General Terms

| Term                        | Definition                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LEC (Lexical Competency)**| Composite metric for symbolic fluency and conceptual accuracy over time.                                    |
| **Hat**                     | Role or domain context (e.g., `pm`, `mlops`) guiding which glossary applies.                               |
| **Glossary_Term**           | Predefined, tracked word or phrase relevant to the active hat.                                             |
| **Typing_Speed**            | Words/characters per minute, normalized to baseline expectations.                                          |
| **Prompt_Seeking_Frequency**| Number of help/clarification requests (neutral: can indicate curiosity or uncertainty).                    |
| **Lexical Friction**        | Observable lag, avoidance, or misuse of terms outside the user’s active vocabulary.                        |
| **Word Competency**         | Inverse of lag, reference, and omission frequencies for a term—core to positive scoring.                   |
| **Contextual Strength**     | How well input matches the current hat/glossary and instruction depth.                                     |

### 2.2 Framing Positive Metrics

| Old Term                  | Positive Reframe        | Description                                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lag                       | Lexical Momentum       | Speed and fluency of symbolic expression (higher = better).      |
| Conceptual Fatigue        | Word Competency        | Ability to fluidly use new/varying terms (higher = better).      |
| Assistance Dependency     | Autonomy Gradient      | Independence in task completion (higher = more autonomous).      |
| Vocabulary Omission       | Lexical Opportunity    | Learning edge—gap between expected and used terms.               |

## 3. Hat-Based Glossaries

Glossaries are modular and contextual—each “hat” has its own tracked terms, which drive LEC scoring.

### 3.1 Example: Project Management (pm)

| Term           | Tier | Definition                                                                   |
|----------------|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stakeholder    | 1    | Any person/group with an interest in the project outcome.                    |
| Gantt chart    | 1    | Bar chart visualizing project schedule.                                      |
| Risk mitigation| 2    | Planning and implementing measures to reduce project risks.                   |
| Deliverables   | 1    | Outcomes required to complete the project.                                   |
| Timeline       | 1    | Chronological schedule of activities and milestones.                         |
| Scope          | 1    | Boundaries and required deliverables of the project.                         |

### 3.2 Example: Machine Learning Operations (mlops)

| Term             | Tier | Definition                                                                    |
|------------------|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pipeline         | 1    | Sequence of steps for building and deploying models.                          |
| Containerization | 1    | Packaging software and dependencies for consistent deployment.                |
| Orchestration    | 2    | Automating/coordinating deployment and scaling of workflows.                  |
| Deployment       | 1    | Moving models into production environments.                                   |
| CI/CD            | 1    | Automated testing and release workflows (Continuous Integration/Deployment).  |
| Monitoring       | 1    | Observing/analyzing models and infrastructure post-deployment.                |

*Tier 2+ terms trigger onboarding or assistive gloss if not previously mastered.*

## 4. LEC Scoring Model

### 4.1 LEC Formula

```plaintext
LEC_score = w1 * (terms_used_correctly / glossary_terms_loaded)
          + w2 * typing_speed_normalized
          + w3 * (1 - avg_response_latency_normalized)
          + w4 * conceptual_depth_score
          - w5 * prompt_seek_penalty
```
- **Weights (w1–w5)**: Tunable by hat, user, or training focus.

### 4.2 Metrics Explained

- **terms_used_correctly**: Count of glossary terms used accurately.
- **typing_speed_normalized**: Characters/words per minute normalized.
- **avg_response_latency_normalized**: Time delay in responding/using a term (lower = better).
- **conceptual_depth_score**: Semantic similarity to ideal usage (embedding-based).
- **prompt_seek_penalty**: Deduction for frequent help/clarification requests (adaptive).

### 4.3 Example LEC Score Record

```json
{
  "user_id": "user_001",
  "session_id": "sess_20250418_123456",
  "timestamp": "2025-04-18T12:34:56Z",
  "hat": "mlops",
  "glossary_terms_loaded": 42,
  "terms_used": [
    { "term": "containerization", "used_correctly": true, "latency_ms": 3200, "character_count": 18 },
    { "term": "pipeline", "used_correctly": false, "latency_ms": 5800, "character_count": 8 }
  ],
  "input_metrics": {
    "characters_per_minute": 148,
    "words_per_minute": 28,
    "avg_response_latency_ms": 4200,
    "prompt_seek_frequency": 3
  },
  "conceptual_usage": {
    "correct_context_usage_pct": 72.4,
    "avg_term_depth_score": 0.68
  },
  "LEC_score": 74.1,
  "score_delta": 3.1,
  "recommendations": [
    "Review 'pipeline' definition",
    "Practice correct use of orchestration vs. automation"
  ]
}
```

## 5. User Experience (UX) & Positive Framing

- **Progress is up:** “Great progress in lexical competency!”  
- **Setbacks are opportunities:** “Try reviewing 3 more terms to improve your LEC this week.”
- **No negative terms:** Avoid “lag”, “fatigue”, “dependency” in user-facing language.

**Graphs:**
- *Up = Good (growth, mastery)*
- *Down = Review Recommended (opportunity)*

---

## 6. Edge-First Processing

- **Most LEC calculations are client-side** for instant feedback and privacy.
- Only deltas, trends, or flagged weak points are sent to central AI for enhancements.
- Reduces server load and latency, empowering real-time learning.

---

## 7. Guidance & Recommendation Engine

- Personalized, context-sensitive suggestions.
- Reacts to low LEC or high friction with targeted micro-lessons, explainer videos, or practice prompts.
- Example:
    ```json
    {
      "hat": "mlops",
      "LEC_score": 61.0,
      "recommendation_module": [
        "Read glossary term: 'orchestration'",
        "Watch 2-minute explainer on CI/CD",
        "Practice quiz with term usage in context"
      ]
    }
    ```

---

## 8. Onboarding & Session Flow (Walkthrough)

### 8.1 Standard Phase Steps

1. **Hat Selection:**  
   “What type of work are you doing?”  
   *(e.g., pm, mlops, syseng)*

2. **Glossary Presentation:**  
   Show baseline hat glossary and usage examples.

3. **Word Competency Introduction:**  
   “You’ll be evaluated on how fluidly you use terms related to this hat.”

4. **Initial Vocabulary Scan:**  
   Lightweight test to calibrate lag, recall, and avoidance.

5. **Active Monitoring:**  
   Track lag, prompt seeking, and word usage in real time, always reinforcing progress.

### 8.2 Lexical Friction Handling

- If a user hesitates or misuses a term:
  - Offer a glossary card inline.
  - Provide examples or micro-lessons.
  - Adapt future prompts to avoid unmastered tier 2+ terms unless user opts in.

---

## 9. Integration with A2A and MCP Standards

- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent):**  
  Ensures clear intent mapping in all actions, requests, and responses.
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol):**  
  Models and prompts remain contextually aware and adjust output to user’s hat, vocabulary profile, and evolving session state.

---

## 10. Extensibility & Modular Design

- **Add new hats easily:**  
  Define glossary, weighting, and onboarding steps.
- **Track by session, hat, and user:**  
  Enables cross-domain skill transfer analysis.
- **Integrate with IDEs (e.g., VS Code):**  
  Onboarding, guidance, and scoring embedded in developer or learner workflows.
